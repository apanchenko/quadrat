## Ideas / proposals

- power Ethereal - can pass through other pieces, not killing them. Cannot be killed eighter. But still can cast abilities.
- open API, so that people may create bots
- power Lenta - similar to Scramble but pieces move together in one direction
- realtime chess - each figure waits after it moves

## Done

- auto export all images from SVG
- scavenger power
- check everything tested - use pack.get
- spawn fixed number of jades on random fields
- beneficiary
- x2
- invisible
- separate core project
- wrp - check function arguments and output consistency
- acidic
- scramble
- purify
- kamikadze
- destroy
- add core.cnt container for countables and non-countables
- learn, pilfer, parasite
- refactor: lowercase source files
- separate model and view
- jump proof
- relocate, diagonal, sphere
